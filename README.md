# Student Management System

This is a **Spring Boot + MongoDB** application for managing student records with a **Thymeleaf frontend**.

## Features
- Add, delete, update, and retrieve student records
- Search students by **name, age, or course**
- Prevent duplicate student IDs
- Generate **random students** with valid names, IDs, and courses
- REST API with `ResponseEntity` for structured responses
- **Thymeleaf UI** for easy interaction

## Technologies Used
- **Spring Boot** (Spring MVC, Spring Data MongoDB)
- **MongoDB** (as the database)
- **Thymeleaf** (for frontend UI)
- **Lombok** (to reduce boilerplate code)
- **Maven** (for dependency management)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/student-management.git
   cd student-management
   ```
2. Configure **MongoDB** (make sure MongoDB is running locally or update `application.properties` with your connection URI).  
3. Build and run the project:  
   ```sh
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```
4. Access the **UI** at:  
   ```
   http://localhost:8080/ui/students/home
   ```
